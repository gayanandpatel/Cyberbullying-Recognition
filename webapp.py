        **How does it work?**
        1. You enter the text of a tweet into the input box.
        2. Click the 'Analyze Text' button.
        3. Our pre-trained machine learning model analyzes the text.
        4. The model predicts the most likely category of cyberbullying.
        5. The prediction is displayed along with a corresponding image.
